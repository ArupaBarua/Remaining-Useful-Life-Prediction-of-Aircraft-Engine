# Remaining-Useful-Life-Prediction-of-Aircraft-Engine
Remaining useful life prediction is an essential task for predicitve maintenance of aircraft engine. By predicting the RUL with less error rate, necessary actions can be taken on time to avoid catastrophic accidents.

The project implements some deep learning models to predict the remaining useful life of aircraft engine. To optimize the best hyperparameters Bayesian Optimization method is used.
Tools used:
- Tensorflow
- Scikit earn
- Optuna

About Dataset
The data set consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each time series is from a different engine. The data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps)
